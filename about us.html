            <p>The Rosales National High School which caters to secondary school youths of Rosales and its neighboring towns, 
                Rosales National High School was founded in 1945 through the initiative of public school officials and prominent
                and civic- spirited of the town, namely, the late Mayor Felix Coloma, Dona Petra Callanta, Don Francisco delos Reyes
                Don Isidro Casanova, Don Conrado Estrella Sr. In September 1945, the school then known as Rosales Junior High School
                has under each educa tional wing the first year students in 1941 that were overtaken by the out break of the Pacific
                war in World War II on December 8, 1941 The fresh- men and sophomore classes were housed temporarily in the
                 Plaridel College Building.</p>

            <p>    From Plaridel College, the school was transferred to another si which is currently occupied by the Rosales North
                 Central School where Quonset Buildings vacated by the American Soldiers were then used as classrooms.</p>

                <p>While classes were going on, the founding fathers and the PTA ne gotiated for the purchased of a perinanent
                 site, meticulously chosen be cause of its healthful environment that is conducive to learning,

                 of the town.<p>
                
              <p> Assured of the funds, the PTA Board of Drectors negotiated with the henn of the late Mr. Alejandro Pablo regarding
                 the comtemplated purchase of his lot situated in the Poblacion of Rosales.</p>
                
                 <p>The new site has an area of 72, 634 square meters under title 22452 registered on February 9, 1957 under
                 TCT No. 1029. It cost the PTA P 50,843 20 as down payment to acquire the cogonal land.</p>

                 of parents and civic spirited cus shacks were constructed and were furnished by the facilities 
                 of the P College donated by Dona Teodora Serafica and family in this school se were enrolled 51
