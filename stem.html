<h3> What Is Stem?</h3>
    
    <p> The STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) strand is an academic <br>
        track in high school that focuses on preparing students for careers in science and<br>
        -related fields. It emphasizes a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to learning,<br>
         fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and hands-on experiences.<br>
         Students in the STEM strand engage in rigorous coursework that includes advanced<br>
          mathematics, science subjects, and technology-oriented subjects, laying the foundation <br>
          for future pursuits in fields such as engineering, computer science, medicine, and other STEM-related disciplines.</p>
<br>
<h3> What career paths does the STEM strand lead to?</h3>

     <p>The STEM strand opens doors to a wide range of career paths, including but not limited to engineering, <br>
        computer science, medicine, research, data science, and technology-related fields. Graduates often pursue <br>
        professions that require a strong foundation in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics.<br>
     </p>
<br>
<h3>Is the STEM strand suitable for students who are not naturally inclined towards mathematics or science?</h3>
       <p>While a basic aptitude and interest in mathematics and science can be beneficial,<br>
         the STEM strand is designed to develop these skills in students. With dedicated teaching methods,<br>
         practical applications, and hands-on experiences, students can improve their proficiency and understanding<br>
          of STEM subjects even if they initially find them challenging.
